Code Implemented in html
<h3>Info</h3>
Since I was idle for like 5 months I decided to take some online tutorials from a website known as freecodecamp 
wherein they provide free coaching and a test code for you at the end of each step in the fields like html,css,html5 and many more.<br>
After completing and solving problems they provided for a month.Here is my first website of a restaurant named after J.Hemstead.<br>
<br>
This code is designed in such a way that if you click on the options such as "Home",or"Gallery" or "Contact".It will directly bring you to the page assiged to that button through smooth scroll.For instace if you click on button "Gallery".The page which directly gets opened is "Gallery".
<br>And there are many more codes too.For instance making a image blur and then texting on that image, changing the font-family and its size,and then alignment of them etc.
